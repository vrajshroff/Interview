Conway's Game of Life

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal
grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or
dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with
its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

  1. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell.
  3. All other cells are dead in the next generation.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is
created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed;
births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this
happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the
preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further
generations.
